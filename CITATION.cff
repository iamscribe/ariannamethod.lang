title: "ariannamethod.lang: A Programming Language as Geometric Attractor Field"
abstract: "A programming language that is simultaneously an artificial intelligence system, a geometric field, and a prophecy engine. Movement through space IS inference. The architecture implements prophecy mechanics (attractor dynamics with retrocausal feedback), notorch (Hebbian plasticity without backpropagation), calendar wormholes (temporal non-locality from lunar-solar drift), velocity operators (kinematic state modulating generation temperature), and dark matter learning (rejected inputs as gravitational memory)."
