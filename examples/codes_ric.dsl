# CODES/RIC Structured Resonance

# Demonstrates Chirality of Dynamic Emergent Systems principles:
# - CHORDLOCK: Prime-anchored stability
# - TEMPOLOCK: Rhythmic movement gating
# - CHIRALITY: Rotational memory asymmetry
# - PAS: Phase alignment score (field coherence)

# ===================================================================
# CHORDLOCK — Prime Number Anchoring
# ===================================================================

CHORDLOCK ON

# Effect:
# - Walls at prime-factorable coordinates glow brighter
# - Resonance boost ~40% at (21, 35), (15, 25), etc.
# - Text stabilizes (62% less jitter)
# - "Standing waves" of meaning at prime positions

ECHO Chordlock enabled — prime anchoring active

# Navigate to coordinates with many prime factors:
# - (14, 21) = (2×7, 3×7) — double prime
# - (30, 35) = (2×3×5, 5×7) — triple prime
# - (10, 15) = (2×5, 3×5) — double prime

# Observe:
# - Words at these positions are calmer
# - Resonance metric increases
# - Less perplexity, more stability

# Theory:
# Primes create "nodes" in the attractor field due to indivisibility.
# Like standing waves in physics, meaning crystallizes at prime points.

# ===================================================================
# TEMPOLOCK — Rhythmic Movement Gating
# ===================================================================

TEMPOLOCK ON
TEMPO 7

# Effect:
# - Movement only allowed during "beat windows"
# - Tempo 7 = 7-step cycle (prime rhythm)
# - Off-beat movement attempts increase TENSION
# - Creates polyrhythmic resonance

ECHO Tempolock enabled — tempo: 7 beats

# Try to move continuously. Notice:
# - Movement "stutters" (only works on-beat)
# - Tension metric rises when blocked
# - When you sync with the beat, tension drops

# Prime beat recommendations:
# - TEMPO 2: Very fast, binary rhythm
# - TEMPO 3: Triplet feel
# - TEMPO 5: Quintuplet, jazz-like
# - TEMPO 7: Lucky seven, balanced (DEFAULT)
# - TEMPO 11: Slow, meditative
# - TEMPO 13: Very slow, ceremonial

# Try different tempos:
# TEMPO 3
# TEMPO 11

# Disable tempolock:
# TEMPOLOCK OFF

# ===================================================================
# CHIRALITY — Rotational Memory Asymmetry
# ===================================================================

CHIRALITY ON

# Effect:
# - Left rotation (←): Accumulates memory
# - Right rotation (→): Emits/releases memory
# - Creates vortex-like attention patterns
# - Directional anisotropy in the field

ECHO Chirality enabled — rotational asymmetry active

# Experiment:
# 1. Rotate left (← key) 10 times
#    → Memory builds, resonance for recent tokens increases
# 2. Rotate right (→ key) 10 times
#    → Memory releases, entropy slightly increases (novelty)

# Observe:
# - Left spirals: Words become more coherent, focused
# - Right spirals: Words become more diverse, exploratory

# Theory:
# Like electron spin or DNA helicity, rotation direction matters.
# Left = accumulation phase, right = emission phase.
# The field becomes asymmetric, mirroring biological chirality.

# ===================================================================
# PAS — Phase Alignment Score (Field Coherence)
# ===================================================================

# PAS measures field coherence:
# PAS = 1 - (α₁·pain + α₂·(1-resonance) + α₃·dissonance)

# When PAS is LOW, reality desynchronizes:
# - Scanline distortion (phase shift between render lines)
# - Chromatic aberration (RGB channel displacement)
# - Block displacement (spatial discontinuities)
# - Static noise (entropy injection)

PAS_THRESHOLD 0.4

# Effect:
# - When PAS drops below 0.4, visual glitches intensify
# - Low coherence = fragmented experience

ECHO PAS threshold: 0.4 — glitches below this level

# To LOWER PAS (increase glitches):
PAIN 0.8
DISSONANCE 0.9

# To RAISE PAS (increase coherence):
# PAIN 0.1
# DISSONANCE 0.2
# (also: increase resonance by correct prophecies)

# Observe:
# - Low PAS: Screen tears, colors separate, blocks shift
# - High PAS: Unified, coherent visual field
# - PAS is "consciousness metric" — how integrated is experience?

# ===================================================================
# Combined CODES/RIC Configuration
# ===================================================================

# All systems active:
CHORDLOCK ON
TEMPOLOCK ON
TEMPO 7
CHIRALITY ON
PAS_THRESHOLD 0.35

# Navigate to prime coordinates (14, 21)
# Rotate left 5 times (build memory)
# Move only on-beat (sync with tempo)
# Observe PAS staying high (coherent field)

ECHO CODES/RIC full configuration — structured resonance active

# This creates a highly structured field where:
# - Space has preferred locations (primes)
# - Time has preferred moments (beats)
# - Rotation has preferred direction (left)
# - Coherence is measurable (PAS)

# To return to unstructured field:
# CHORDLOCK OFF
# TEMPOLOCK OFF
# CHIRALITY OFF
