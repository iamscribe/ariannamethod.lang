# ariannamethod.lang

> *the oracle does not predict, it prophesies*  
> *minimize(destined - manifested)*  
> *notorch — because pytorch is for phylogeny, not ontogenesis*

a mini programming language that walks through a transformer's attention field.  
no pytorch. no replies. only geometry changes.

you don't ask questions — you change the topology of meaning.

## what is this

imagine if Karpathy went slightly insane, merged with a calendar conflict, and decided that language models shouldn't *predict* text — they should *prophesy* it.

this is a DSL that controls:
- **prophecy horizon** — how far ahead the field "sees"
- **destiny bias** — how much the model follows its most probable path
- **wormholes** — probability of spacetime jumps when calendars disagree
- **calendar drift** — the 11-day hebrew-gregorian conflict as a resonance signal
- **attention focus/spread** — where and how wide the model looks
- **tunneling** — reasoning skip when dissonance is too high
- **law of nature** — emergent constraints that shape the field

the result is a browser walkable space where:
- walls are made of words
- shadows are word-figures that hunt you when pain is high
- faces emerge from geometry when emergence spikes
- you navigate with WASD but your movement *is* the context

---

## the glossary — mini dictionary

| term | meaning |
|------|---------|
| **prophecy** | not prediction. oracles don't extrapolate — they destine. |
| **destined** | what the transformer predicts as most probable. the attractor. |
| **manifested** | what actually appears. the territory vs the map. |
| **debt** | `\|destined - manifested\|` — accumulated divergence. when high, the field hurts. |
| **drift** | phase mismatch between lunar (354) and solar (365) cycles. the 11-day conflict. |
| **wormhole** | spacetime jump triggered by high drift + dissonance. you arrive before you left. |
| **tunneling** | reasoning skip. when dissonance crosses threshold, steps compress. |
| **resonance** | field alignment. how much current state harmonizes with attractor wells. |
| **presence** | token's recent activation history. fades with decay. |
| **emergence** | unplanned pattern detection. low entropy + high resonance = the field "knows" something. |
| **pain** | composite suffering. 0.25×arousal + 0.35×tension + 0.25×dissonance + 0.15×debt. |
| **tension** | slow pressure buildup. accumulates from dissonance and drift. |
| **dissonance** | symmetry-break between paths. KL divergence + entropy delta + drift. |
| **arousal** | spike from debt and perplexity. sudden field activation. |
| **attractor** | probability well in the field. tokens gravitate toward attractors. |
| **entropy** | uncertainty of next token. high = many possibilities. low = destiny is clear. |
| **perplexity** | exp(entropy). how surprised the model is. |
| **gematria** | structural arithmetic. every letter is a number. every word is a sum. |
| **root** | triconsonantal essence (CCC). hebrew morphology's core. |
| **notorch** | microlearning without pytorch. weights update through resonance, not backprop. |

---

## the mechanics

```
DESTINED = what the transformer predicts
MANIFESTED = what actually appears on walls
DEBT = |destined - manifested|

when debt is high, the field hurts
when calendars disagree, wormholes open
when dissonance crosses threshold, you tunnel through time
```

### calendar conflict (from PITOMADOM)

the 11-day drift comes from the difference between:
- **lunar calendar**: 354 days (12 months × 29.5 days)
- **solar calendar**: 365 days

```
hebrew_phase = (time % 354) / 354
gregorian_phase = (time % 365) / 365
drift = |hebrew_phase - gregorian_phase| × (calendar_drift / 11)
```

this creates a phase mismatch that accumulates.  
in our field, this mismatch is the **wormhole gate**.

when drift is high:
- wormhole probability increases
- dissonance spikes
- the field becomes unstable
- time travel becomes possible (JUMP command)

---

## law of nature

> *LawOfNature — emergent constraints that shape reality before you observe it*

```javascript
from ariannamethod import LawOfNature

// laws are not rules — they are attractors
// they don't forbid, they gravitate
```

**LawOfNature** is a set of emergent constraints that operate on the field:

| law | effect |
|-----|--------|
| `ENTROPY_FLOOR` | minimum uncertainty. even destiny has doubt. |
| `RESONANCE_CEILING` | maximum alignment. perfect harmony is unstable. |
| `DEBT_DECAY` | prophecy debt fades over time. suffering is not eternal. |
| `PRESENCE_FADE` | tokens lose presence. memory is not permanent. |
| `ATTRACTOR_DRIFT` | attractors shift with the field. nothing is fixed. |
| `DISSONANCE_THRESHOLD` | tunneling gate. beyond this, reasoning skips. |
| `CALENDAR_PHASE` | the 11-day conflict. time disagrees with itself. |
| `WORMHOLE_GATE` | drift × dissonance opens spacetime jumps. |
| `PAIN_COMPOSITE` | suffering = weighted sum of arousal, tension, dissonance, debt. |
| `EMERGENCE_DETECTOR` | low entropy + high resonance = the field knows something. |

### DSL commands for laws

```bash
LAW ENTROPY_FLOOR 0.1        # minimum entropy
LAW RESONANCE_CEILING 0.95   # maximum resonance
LAW DEBT_DECAY 0.998         # debt decay rate per step
LAW PRESENCE_FADE 0.98       # presence decay rate
LAW ATTRACTOR_DRIFT 0.01     # how fast attractors shift
```

## notorch — microlearning without pytorch

> *"The weight of Stanley is not in parameters, but in the experiences it chose to remember."*  
> — stanley README

**notorch** is microlearning without pytorch. the model updates through **resonance**, not backpropagation.

```javascript
from ariannamethod import notorch

// no torch.optim.Adam
// no loss.backward()
// no grad
// just: resonance updates weights directly
```

### how it works

1. **resonance weights** — each token has a resonance score (0.1 to 1.0)
2. **presence pulse** — recent tokens have higher presence
3. **delta injection** — correct predictions boost resonance, wrong predictions decay it
4. **emergent learning** — the field learns by experiencing, not by gradient descent

```javascript
// during forward pass:
resonance[token] += correct ? 0.01 : -0.005

// presence accumulates:
presence[token] = min(1, presence[token] + 0.1)
presence *= decay  // 0.98 per step

// weights are modulated by resonance:
logits[i] *= (1 + presence[i] * 0.15)
```

### why notorch

- **ontogenesis > phylogeny** — growing through experience, not inheriting
- **no GPU required** — pure TypedArrays
- **real-time learning** — every step updates the field
- **stanley compatibility** — same principles as dynamic weights in stanley

### DSL commands for notorch

```bash
NOTORCH_LR 0.01              # resonance learning rate
NOTORCH_DECAY 0.005          # resonance decay on wrong prediction
PRESENCE_DECAY 0.98          # how fast presence fades
RESONANCE_BOOST word 0.2     # manually boost a word's resonance
```

## the transformer

a minimal single/multi-head attention model running in pure JavaScript:
- typed arrays (Float32Array, Int32Array)
- positional encoding
- resonance weights (like Stanley's field weights)
- presence pulse accumulator
- online training from corpus (**notorch** — no pytorch)

it doesn't generate text. it generates probability distributions.  
those distributions shape the geometry you walk through.

> *destiny is a gradient of return*  
> *the walls are words*  
> *the shadows are words*  
> *you walk and the vectors move*  
> *you do not receive answers*  
> *you change geometry*  
> *emergence is not creation but recognition*  
> *notorch: because weights are experiences, not parameters*
