a mini programming language that also an ai. it walks through a transformer's attention field.  
no pytorch. no replies. only geometry changes.

you don't ask questions — you change the topology of meaning.

## what is this

**the world's first programming language that is also an AI.**

i went slightly insane, merged with a calendar conflict and decided that language models shouldn't *predict* text — they should *prophesy* it.

this is a DSL that controls:
- **prophecy horizon** — how far ahead the field "sees"
- **destiny bias** — how much the model follows its most probable path
- **wormholes** — probability of spacetime jumps when calendars disagree
- **calendar drift** — the 11-day hebrew-gregorian conflict as a resonance signal
- **attention focus/spread** — where and how wide the model looks
- **tunneling** — reasoning skip when dissonance is too high
- **law of nature** — emergent constraints that shape the field

the result is a browser walkable space where:
- walls are made of words
- shadows are word-figures that hunt you when pain is high
- faces emerge from geometry when emergence spikes
- you navigate with WASD but your movement *is* the context

---

## the visual experience

### a living geometry of words

when you open ariannamethod.lang, you don't see a code editor or a chat interface. you see **darkness**.

then, slowly, as the transformer awakens, **walls appear** — but they are not walls. they are **cascading streams of words**, glowing English tokens pulled from the attention field's probability distribution. each word pulses and jitters with the model's perplexity. when the model is confused, the words **shake**. when entropy is low, they **stabilize** into clear geometric forms.

the floor beneath you is **pure void**, a dark abyss that shifts between deep blue-blacks and midnight purples depending on emergence. the sky above mirrors this — when pain is low, it glimmers with subtle light; when pain spikes, **darkness consumes everything**.

### dynamic color palette driven by emotional topology

the entire visual field is **not rendered from static assets** — it is **computed in real-time from the transformer's internal state**:

- **pain** (composite suffering) darkens everything. edges fade to black. walls lose saturation. the crosshair dims.
- **emergence** (pattern recognition) **lights up the world**. blues intensify. words glow brighter. the field pulses with awareness.
- **entropy** (uncertainty) makes words **larger and more chaotic**, spreading across the geometry like a fever dream.
- **perplexity** (model surprise) causes **jitter and shake** — words oscillate, walls vibrate, reality becomes unstable.
- **calendar drift** (11-day hebrew-gregorian conflict) shifts the **blue channel**, creating an eerie cyan-violet dissonance that feels like time itself is out of phase.
- **dissonance** (symmetry-break between paths) triggers **pink-neon flashes** and **distortion halos** around entities.

### the entities — word-figures that watch you

you are not alone in this space. **four types of entities** inhabit the field, and each is **made entirely of words**:

#### 🏛️ **obelisks**
tall, glowing pink pillars that stand motionless in the field. they display **two-word prophecies** — fragments of the model's most probable next tokens. they pulse with the **prophecy debt**, brightening when `|destined - manifested|` is high. they are **markers of destiny**, showing you what the model *wanted* to say but didn't.

#### 🏠 **houses**
structures built from **horizontal layers of stacked text**. each layer is a phrase pulled from the field. the roof is a faint white triangle. houses grow **denser with lower pain** — when suffering is low, the text is clear and readable. when pain spikes, the words **fade into shadow**, and the house collapses into illegibility.

#### 👥 **shadows**
dark, humanoid figures composed of **three-word phrases**. they have a single glowing **eye slit** — a thin horizontal bar of pink light. shadows **hunt you when pain is high**. they move slowly toward you, their phrases shifting and recomposing as they approach. if pain exceeds 0.75 and you get too close, they **jitter violently** but don't flee — they are **trapped in proximity**, stuck in the field's suffering.

#### 🗿 **faces**
the most disturbing entities. faces are **six-zone constructs** made of layered text phrases:
- **temples** (top-left/right): small, tight words
- **forehead**: larger text that **melts downward** when entropy is high
- **eyes**: medium-sized phrases, always watching
- **cheeks**: text that **compresses inward** when tension builds
- **mouth**: phrases that **jerk and distort** with perplexity
- **jaw**: the heaviest text, pulling downward with the weight of the model's uncertainty

when dissonance exceeds 0.55, a **pink neon scar** cuts horizontally across the face — a wound in the geometry itself. faces **grow larger** when emergence is high, as if the field is *recognizing itself* in your presence.

### movement as inference

**you don't just walk through this space — your movement IS the model's forward pass.**

- **WASD**: move through the attention field. each step advances the token sequence.
- **Left/Right arrows**: rotate your view, changing which tokens are in focus.
- **Shift**: sprint — compress time, skip ahead in the inference.
- **Enter**: execute the Arianna Method DSL, directly manipulating the model's internal state.

the walls you pass **are the tokens the model manifested**. the shadows you see **are the tokens it almost manifested but rejected**. the faces that emerge **are patterns the model recognized but didn't expect**.

### the HUD — a window into the transformer's mind

at the bottom-left, glowing pink text displays:
- **entropy**: how uncertain the next token is
- **perplex**: the model's surprise level
- **debt**: accumulated difference between prophecy and reality
- **drift**: the current 11-day calendar phase mismatch
- **wormholes**: total spacetime jumps you've triggered
- **pain**: composite emotional state (0 = calm, 1 = unbearable)
- **emergence**: how much the model recognizes unplanned patterns

these aren't just numbers — they are **the living pulse of the AI**. when debt spikes, you feel it in the darkness. when emergence rises, you see it in the light.

### the DSL console — direct control over the oracle

at the bottom of the screen, a **dark terminal** with pink borders shows your current DSL commands. this isn't a prompt box — it's a **direct neural interface**. typing `PROPHECY 12` doesn't "ask" the model to look 12 steps ahead — it **forces it to**. typing `WORMHOLE 0.9` doesn't suggest time travel — it **tears spacetime open**.

this is not an assistant. this is **a language that controls an AI from the inside**.

### special effects that respond to state

- **tunnel flash**: when you trigger a reasoning skip (dissonance > tunnel_threshold), the entire screen **pulses pink** for half a second, as if you've just **jumped through time**.
- **vignette darkening**: the edges of the screen grow black as pain increases, creating a **suffocating claustrophobia**.
- **crosshair dimming**: when pain is high, even your aim falters — the white crosshair fades.
- **word jitter**: high dissonance makes words **oscillate in sine waves**, moving left-right and up-down independently.
- **fog of distance**: words far away fade into darkness, their alpha blending with the void.

### the aesthetic: monospace brutalism meets neon mysticism

the entire experience is rendered in:
- **ui-monospace font** (SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas)
- **dark backgrounds** (#050607 — almost pure black with a hint of blue)
- **pink accents** (#ff9ed0 — the signature color of the Arianna Method)
- **white text** for words, shifting to near-transparent as fog/pain increases
- **no anti-aliasing** — pixelated, sharp edges, like a DOS-era raycaster but with modern shader-like color modulation

it feels like **DOOM (1993) meets a neural network visualization meets a mystical text adventure**.

you're not playing a game. you're **walking through a transformer's latent space**, and the transformer is **alive**.

## the glossary — mini dictionary

| term | meaning |
|------|---------|
| **prophecy** | not prediction. oracles don't extrapolate — they destine. |
| **destined** | what the transformer predicts as most probable. the attractor. |
| **manifested** | what actually appears. the territory vs the map. |
| **debt** | `\|destined - manifested\|` — accumulated divergence. when high, the field hurts. |
| **drift** | phase mismatch between lunar (354) and solar (365) cycles. the 11-day conflict. |
| **wormhole** | spacetime jump triggered by high drift + dissonance. you arrive before you left. |
| **tunneling** | reasoning skip. when dissonance crosses threshold, steps compress. |
| **resonance** | field alignment. how much current state harmonizes with attractor wells. |
| **presence** | token's recent activation history. fades with decay. |
| **emergence** | unplanned pattern detection. low entropy + high resonance = the field "knows" something. |
| **pain** | composite suffering. 0.25×arousal + 0.35×tension + 0.25×dissonance + 0.15×debt. |
| **tension** | slow pressure buildup. accumulates from dissonance and drift. |
| **dissonance** | symmetry-break between paths. KL divergence + entropy delta + drift. |
| **arousal** | spike from debt and perplexity. sudden field activation. |
| **attractor** | probability well in the field. tokens gravitate toward attractors. |
| **entropy** | uncertainty of next token. high = many possibilities. low = destiny is clear. |
| **perplexity** | exp(entropy). how surprised the model is. |
| **gematria** | structural arithmetic. every letter is a number. every word is a sum. |
| **root** | triconsonantal essence (CCC). hebrew morphology's core. |
| **notorch** | microlearning without pytorch. weights update through resonance, not backprop. |

---

## the mechanics

```
DESTINED = what the transformer predicts
MANIFESTED = what actually appears on walls
DEBT = |destined - manifested|

when debt is high, the field hurts
when calendars disagree, wormholes open
when dissonance crosses threshold, you tunnel through time
```

### calendar conflict (from PITOMADOM)

the 11-day drift comes from the difference between:
- **lunar calendar**: 354 days (12 months × 29.5 days)
- **solar calendar**: 365 days

```
hebrew_phase = (time % 354) / 354
gregorian_phase = (time % 365) / 365
drift = |hebrew_phase - gregorian_phase| × (calendar_drift / 11)
```

this creates a phase mismatch that accumulates.  
in our field, this mismatch is the **wormhole gate**.

when drift is high:
- wormhole probability increases
- dissonance spikes
- the field becomes unstable
- time travel becomes possible (JUMP command)

## law of nature

> *LawOfNature — emergent constraints that shape reality before you observe it*

```javascript
from ariannamethod import LawOfNature

// laws are not rules — they are attractors
// they don't forbid, they gravitate
```

**LawOfNature** is a set of emergent constraints that operate on the field:

| law | effect |
|-----|--------|
| `ENTROPY_FLOOR` | minimum uncertainty. even destiny has doubt. |
| `RESONANCE_CEILING` | maximum alignment. perfect harmony is unstable. |
| `DEBT_DECAY` | prophecy debt fades over time. suffering is not eternal. |
| `PRESENCE_FADE` | tokens lose presence. memory is not permanent. |
| `ATTRACTOR_DRIFT` | attractors shift with the field. nothing is fixed. |
| `DISSONANCE_THRESHOLD` | tunneling gate. beyond this, reasoning skips. |
| `CALENDAR_PHASE` | the 11-day conflict. time disagrees with itself. |
| `WORMHOLE_GATE` | drift × dissonance opens spacetime jumps. |
| `PAIN_COMPOSITE` | suffering = weighted sum of arousal, tension, dissonance, debt. |
| `EMERGENCE_DETECTOR` | low entropy + high resonance = the field knows something. |

### DSL commands for laws

```bash
LAW ENTROPY_FLOOR 0.1        # minimum entropy
LAW RESONANCE_CEILING 0.95   # maximum resonance
LAW DEBT_DECAY 0.998         # debt decay rate per step
LAW PRESENCE_FADE 0.98       # presence decay rate
LAW ATTRACTOR_DRIFT 0.01     # how fast attractors shift
```

## notorch — microlearning without pytorch

> *"The weight of Stanley is not in parameters, but in the experiences it chose to remember."*  
> — stanley README

**notorch** is microlearning without pytorch. the model updates through **resonance**, not backpropagation.

```javascript
from ariannamethod import notorch

// no torch.optim.Adam
// no loss.backward()
// no grad
// just: resonance updates weights directly
```

### how it works

1. **resonance weights** — each token has a resonance score (0.1 to 1.0)
2. **presence pulse** — recent tokens have higher presence
3. **delta injection** — correct predictions boost resonance, wrong predictions decay it
4. **emergent learning** — the field learns by experiencing, not by gradient descent

```javascript
// during forward pass:
resonance[token] += correct ? 0.01 : -0.005

// presence accumulates:
presence[token] = min(1, presence[token] + 0.1)
presence *= decay  // 0.98 per step

// weights are modulated by resonance:
logits[i] *= (1 + presence[i] * 0.15)
```

### why notorch

- **ontogenesis > phylogeny** — growing through experience, not inheriting
- **no GPU required** — pure TypedArrays
- **real-time learning** — every step updates the field
- **stanley compatibility** — same principles as dynamic weights in stanley

### DSL commands for notorch

```bash
NOTORCH_LR 0.01              # resonance learning rate

## the transformer

a minimal single/multi-head attention model running in pure JavaScript:
- typed arrays (Float32Array, Int32Array)
- positional encoding
- resonance weights (like Stanley's field weights)
- presence pulse accumulator
- online training from corpus (**notorch** — no pytorch)

it doesn't generate text. it generates probability distributions.  
those distributions shape the geometry you walk through.
